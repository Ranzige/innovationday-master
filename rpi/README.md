TEXAS Instruments SENSOR TAG and Raspberry PI 3 Model B using Bluetooth Low Energy
===================================================================================

This is a simple example for the TI SensorTag using RaspberryPi 3.0 Model B which has already embedded a Bluetooth Low Engery (BLE GATT) antenna.

As a first example I have integrated in the python file the collection of data measurements from:
1. IR and Ambient Temperature
2. Luminance
3. Humidity
4. Barometric Pressure 

In the website of Texas Instruments you can find more information on the details of the other sensors. The logic is the same; you should at first
enable the sensor using the appropriate value for the appropriate register and then read the output from the appropriate register. 
The website of sensor tag is:  
http://www.ti.com/ww/en/wireless_connectivity/sensortag2015/?INTC=SensorTag 
and this:

**************Instructions***************

Before you start you will need to install the python pexpect libray using the following command:

 sudo pip install pexpect

To enable the bluetooth adaptor and find your SensorTag device address do the following -

    sudo hciconfig hci0 up
    sudo hcitool lescan 

Press the side button and you should get a couple of lines showing the device is working. 
You should see something like this: 

	B0:B4:48:C8:41:81 CC2650 SensorTag

Hit Ctrl-C to exit.  Now you're ready to go -

    python sensortag.py [ADDRESS] example: python sensortag.py B0:B4:48:C8:41:81
